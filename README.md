### Project Lampy 

Project contributors: Ada and Nathan

Phillips Hue light controller that changes colour to let us know if it is time to take out cans and garbage or it is time to
take out the cardboard.

If Lampy is blue, then it is recycling and garbage day!
If Lampy is green, then it is cardboard day!
